To realise fault-tolerant universal quantum computation it is important to consider the resources required in implementing quantum circuits. For many types of quantum error correction code including the surface code, a special class of so-called Clifford operations can be implemented transversally, such that the physical implementation of a logical operator acts independently on each qubit with the same code block. Transversality means that the operator is natively protected against errors by the error correction code and the resources required are linear in the number of physical qubit and therefore are assumed to be cheap, perfect resources. However, Clifford operations alone are insufficient for universal quantum computation. The T gate is the common choice for the non-Clifford gate, whose fault-tolerant implementation is not transversal. Typically, it requires the distillation of many noisy resource states called magic states into few high-fidelity states over several rounds. The state can then be teleported into a circuit using a scheme such as (blah). The distillation and teleportation stages can be performed with physical Clifford operations but involve many more physical Clifford operations than those of logical Cliffords. Therefore, it is important to understand how best we can optimize quantum circuits with respect to the number of T gates.
