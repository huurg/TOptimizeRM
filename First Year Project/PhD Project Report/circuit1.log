! LaTeX Error: \usepackage before \documentclass.

\usepackage may only appear in the document preamble, i.e.,
between \documentclass and \begin{document}.

The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

If that doesn't work, type  X <return>  to quit.

! Misplaced alignment tab character &.
l.6 	&
     \gate{X} & \qw
I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.
